# Shopping Cart 🛒

This is my Shopping Cart project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart) React section.

It’s built with **Vite + React** and uses **React Router** for navigation.

- Shop page that fetches products from [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/)
- Product page with details, quantity selector, and add-to-cart
- Cart page with item list, subtotal, and a fake checkout button
- Persistent header + footer layout
